# Modern version of ExpenseReport with namespaces and PHPUnit

This PHP implementation of the ExpenseReport is more compliant to current PHP
standards (see https://www.php-fig.org/).

The folder now contains a "composer.json" file for dependency management and
the makefile contains targets to build the app (`make all` or simply `make`)
and run the unit-tests (`make tests`).

The configuration file for [PHPUnit](https://phpunit.de/) is sufficient to
start with simple tests and provides a first simple example on how to test the
output which is generated by the initial version of the ExpenseReport.

Happy Coding!
