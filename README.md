# ExpenseReport
![License: CC-BY-SA](by-sa.svg)
The ExpenseReport legacy code refactoring kata in various languages.

This is an example of a piece of legacy code with lots of code smells.
The goal is to support the following new feature as best as you can:
* Add Lunch with an expense limit of 2000.

## Process
1. üìö Read the code to understand what it does and how it works.
2. ü¶® Read the code and check for design and code smells. Make a list of all code and design smells that you find.
3. üßë‚Äçüî¨ Analyze what you would have to change to implement the new requirement without refactoring the code.
4. üß™ Write a characterization test. Expand your list of code and design smells. Add those smells that you missed earlier and discovered now because they made your life writing a test miserable.
5. üîß Refactor the code.
6. üîß Refactor the test.
7. üëº Test-drive the new feature.

## Languages explicitly not planned
- Brainfuck
- False
- Malbolge
- Whitespace

## Undecided Languages
There are many more programming languages than in the list above.
Find a more complete list on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_programming_languages).

## Other plans
- Make sure that all languages are providing the identical challenge.
  To be practical, this will require the removal of the timestamp side-effect.
- Provide the time-stamp side-effect on a separate branch.
- Provide a test setup (without test) on a separate branch so that folks can choose whether they want to include the setup work in the kata or not.
- Provide a level 2 challenge for creating an HTML report besides the Plain Text report.

## Solutions
**Warning** The solutions branch will be rebased and force-pushed!

Currently, solutions exist in the following languages:
- [Ada](expensereport-ada/)
- [Assembler](expensereport-asm-68k-masm/) (Motorola 68020, Amiga OS, MaxonASM)
- [Assembler](expensereport-asm-aarch64-linux-gasm/) (AArch64, Linux, GNU Assembler)

- [Fortran](expensereport-fortran/)
- [Go](expensereport-go/) (with BDD)
- [Groovy](expensereport-groovy-script/)
- [Haskell](expensereport-haskell/)
- [Java](expensereport-java/) (with BDD)

- [Rust](expensereport-rust/)
- [SQL](expensereport-sql/)
- [XML/XSLT](expensereport-xslt/)

### Solution Rationale
- Make adding the new requirement (lunch with an expense limit 2000) as easy and simple and error-free as possible. That means solving the OCP-violations of `printReport()`.
- Small ("atomic") functions. Extract until you can no longer reasonably extract further methods.
- A balance between a language independent design expressed idiomatic in the target language.

Currently, soltuions exist in the following languages:
- [Java](expensereport-java/)
- [Kotlin](expensereport-kotlin/)
- [Rust](expensereport-rust/)

## Credits and License
I first encountered the ExpenseReport example during a bootcamp at Equal Experts.
I also have seen the ExpenseReport example being used by Robert "Uncle Bob" C. Martin.
However, he seems to not be the original author (https://twitter.com/unclebobmartin/status/1537063143326855176?s=20&t=lh_vVb9jUQmY6PYG50974w)
I have tried to research its origins but so far I have failed.
If you know who has first come up with this example, please get in touch with me.

As I was asked for the license conditions, I have decided to put this under CC-BY-SA, with the following considerations:
- Please credit me, last but not least to retain the opportunity for people to experience this exercise in as many programming languages as they are interested in.
- Share it under the same license.
- Using this as training material should be allowed, even if the trainer is charging money for their time.

Disclaimer: As stated above, I did not come up with the original version.
The original author is unknown to me.
The CC-BY-SA license thus can only cover my contribution: Recreating the Java version from memory, creating the versions in other programming languages than Java, and keeping them consistent.
